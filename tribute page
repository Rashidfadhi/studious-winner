 Lamarr's early years were characterized by a blend of intellectual curiosity and artistic exposure. She received private tutoring, was a proficient pianist and dancer by age 10, and spoke multiple languages. At 16, she enrolled in Max Reinhardt's dramatic school in Berlin. She made her motion picture debut in the 1930 German film Geld auf der Straße (Money on the Street).
Lamarr achieved both stardom and notoriety in the 1932 Czech film Ecstasy, which gained international attention for featuring brief nudity. This success was followed by a tumultuous marriage in 1933 to Austrian munitions manufacturer Fritz Mandl, a controlling figure who tried to halt her acting career. Through her marriage, Lamarr was exposed to conversations about wartime weaponry and military technology, knowledge she would later apply to her invention. She successfully escaped Mandl in 1937, fleeing to London.
